        Load databases from [Web of Science](https://www.webofknowledge.com), [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com), [Scielo](https://www.webofknowledge.com), etc, and combine the results into a single database
        
        For WOSplus execution it is recommended to define `drive.cfg` file in which you can specify the name of the files and its shared keys in Google drive. The `drive.cfg` file must be present in the execution folder. For example
        ``` bash
        $ cat drive.cfg
        [FILES]
        CIB_Scielo.xlsx    = 0BxoOXsn2EUNIMldPUFlwNkdLOTQ
        ```
        See also the `drive.cfg` file in the test folder which gives some addresses of sample databases stored in google drive. If the file is not found in the google drive cloud, it is searched and loaded locally, by using just the name of the file.
        ## Installation
        Python 3 is required
